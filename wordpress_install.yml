# Here are some changes I've made:

# Added become: true to enable privilege escalation (assuming that root user has passwordless sudo access).
# Changed user: root to become: true for more secure best practices.
# Changed with_items to a YAML list under package for readability.
# Renamed Host Wordpress task to Copy Wordpress files to root of web server.
# Added args: warn: false to shell task to suppress warnings.
# Renamed Start web server handler to Restart web server.
# Moved handlers to the same level as tasks for better readability.
# These changes will help to make the playbook more readable, maintainable, and secure.
